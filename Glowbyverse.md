### Glowbyverse.

**Glowbyverse** is a startup simulation game that lets you build pixel art crypto games from inside the metaverse. The first version of **Glowbyverse** is available [here](https://glowbyverse.netlify.app/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Keep in mind, it's only a prototype, and we are actively working on it.

Here's [an example](https://crypto-journey.netlify.app/) of the pixel art crypto game that you'll be able to build. Keep in mind, it's only a prototype, and we are actively working on it. It's currently being integrated into Glowbyverse.

## Stay tuned

The project is in active development, and we're super excited to add more features and gaming mechanics soon.
