## Glowbom Glowbyverse

**Glowbyverse** is a part of [Glowbom](https://glowbom.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a tech-agnostic no-code/low-code tool that lets you build apps and games without the need to code with the ability to export to Flutter, Unity, SwiftUI, and Kotlin Jetpack Compose. [Here's how it works...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEnlP_f0jG4){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
 
### Glowbyverse.

**Glowbyverse** is a startup simulation game that lets you build pixel art crypto games from inside the metaverse. The first version of **Glowbyverse** is available [here](https://glowbyverse.netlify.app/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Keep in mind, it's only a prototype, and we are actively working on it.

In the simulation game you can:

Create your own company:

Here's [an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBey-ND_D0A) of the pixel art crypto game that you'll be able to build. Keep in mind, it's only a prototype, and we are actively working on it. It's currently being integrated into Glowbyverse.

## Stay tuned

The project is in active development, and we're super excited to add more features and gaming mechanics soon.
