### Glowbyverse.

**Glowbyverse** is a startup simulation game that lets you build pixel art crypto games from inside the metaverse. The first version is available [here](https://glowbyverse.netlify.app/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. In the metaverse you can create your own company, open offices around the world, manage fundraising, and building crpyo apps from inside the metaverse. Keep in mind, it's only a prototype, and we are actively working on it.
