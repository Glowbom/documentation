## Metaverse for building apps

**Glowbyverse** is a part of [**Glowbom**](https://glowbom.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a tech-agnostic no-code/low-code tool that lets you build apps and games without the need to code with the ability to export to Flutter, Unity, SwiftUI, and Kotlin Jetpack Compose. [Here's how it works...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEnlP_f0jG4){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
 
### Glowbyverse

**Glowbyverse** is a startup simulation game that lets you build pixel art crypto games from inside the metaverse. The first version of **Glowbyverse** is available [here](https://glowbyverse.netlify.app/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. In the metaverse, you can create your own company, fundraise, open offices around the world, and build crypto apps from inside the metaverse. Keep in mind that we are actively working on it. Itâ€™s only a prototype.

Here's [an example](https://crypto-journey.netlify.app/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of the pixel art crypto game that you'll be able to build. This example was built at [ETH SF](https://sf.ethglobal.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} using web3.js, JavaScript, C#, Unity, Alchemy, MetaMask, TypeScript, Solidity, Hardhat, Mocha, Polygon, Optimism, and Empiric Network. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/globalsculptor/crypto-journey){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Keep in mind that we are actively working on it. It's currently being integrated into **Glowbyverse**. 

## Stay tuned

The project is in active development, and we're super excited to add more features and gaming mechanics soon. Future versions of **Glowbyverse** will also include deep integration with design tools like Figma for even easier idea-to-deployment capabilities.
